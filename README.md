# D3-Challenge

The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.

There seems to be a correlation between being in poverty and the lack of healthcare. This could be a two-way interaction. Health care can be significantly expensive in the United States and these expenses can lead to debt and poverty. Being in poverty could also mean a lack of funds for things like health care. 

Seeing the difference between states can give us further insights. Each state has a vast difference in policy when it comes to factors that determine health risks. More investigation into why certain states have higher poverty rates and lack of health care is needed.
