          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty Rate and Lack of Healthcare</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>This data set is a combination from the US Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. 
            The information is vast with data such as income, age, obesity, etc. 
            The chart is viewing the potential health risk factors of poverty percentage and lack of healthcare percentage.</p>

          <p>There seems to be a correlation between being in poverty and the lack of healthcare. 
            This could be a two-way interaction. Healthcare can be significantly expensive in the United States and these expenses can lead to debt and poverty. 
            Being in poverty could also mean a lack of funds for things like healthcare. </p>

          <p>Seeing the difference between states can give us further insights. 
            Each state has a vast difference in policy when it comes to factors that determine health risks. 
            More investigation into why certain states have higher poverty rates and lack of healthcare is needed. </p>
